- The description says I live in Melbourne, but these days I live in a small
  box in Hong Kong
- I dont work for Lenovo (or IBM) - I never have - I was just a fan of their
  hardware
- You might call it Dev Ops these days
  I've been calling it Sys Admin for years
- Dissassembling things, finding out how things work, this is all part of the
  same thing for me.
- Sometimes I even put them back together
- it seems this is the room for grumpy old men who dont like their laptops
  this morning..

- Of course, there is an XKCD for this
- .. But - concerned about the pattern that the computer/design industry
  is taking (cheapening and mass-producing/lowest-common-denominatoring)

NOTE: be aware of the timing needed to read the comic - say min 20sec

<!-- ** What is in this talk -->

# This talk

- What is wrong with current Laptops?

- How much can I change the hardware?

- What is needed to change the software?

- How does the firmware get flashed?

- What can we do next?

???
TODO: these set of notes dont give me hints on what to say (yet)

- There are four main points that I think I can get across
- Encourage people to be able to make changes to the hardware around them
- get people back into the mentality of questioning their 'perfect', 'shiny'
  new toys - "what can I change??"
- Actually changing/fixing the firmware
- firmware flashing includes
  - Going further with exploration and possible exploitation
  - Write a KVM-based hypervisor
- What Next

# Chapter 1: Why

---

<!-- ** Why did I do it (what motivated me) -->

# Why did I start my fight?

- Today's hardware is just not for me

- To be fair, I'm a small group

- Is it new features at the *expense* of old ones?

- You should feel like you *could* do something about it

???
- Increasingly, hardware doesnt seem to meet my requirements
- evolution of hardware
- beyond a certain point smaller is not always better (thinner means less room
  for ports and less keyboard travel)
- I certainly dont want cheaper at the cost of quality
- touch on open source, helping making changes
- There is a constant and growing feeling that none of the designs
    are catering for my needs and wants.  This could be because I am
    old and crusty, but the point is that I dont like feeling that way.
    I assume that others have had the same feeling and want to encourage
    you in doing things about it.
- Note, I say *could* - I dont expect everyone to want to, or to succeed.

- could do a quick room survey and note the number of thinkpads diminishing
  over the years

???
- Historically, I have just looked at the Thinkpad laptops
- Looking at other ranges, I see many of the same things - starting sooner,
    perhaps
- Smaller means a lot of things, many of which I can cope with
- sometimes smaller just means less room for the battery - which is bad

   <ul>
    <li><p>Easily portable

</table>

???
- Portability speaks to the maximum size - not a portable gaming rig
  and certainly not large enough to fit a numberpad!
- all-day use is about erganomics, which - amungst other things - relates
  to screen quality and since I will be typing all day - the keyboard
- Beyond (say) 4 hours, battery life is more something nice to have, with
  the assumption that if I am working all day, I am at probably near a
  power point for some of that time.  Of course, it has to reliably hit
  the 4 hour mark.
- runs linux, should be obvious
- Even the Purism people have blobs that they were not able to remove from
  their laptops (eg: M.E. blob)
- And the Novena isnt actually a laptop
- mention pi-top?
- durable - survives being used as a laptop

- have had a number of thinkpads almost hit all of that (over the
  years) - this I kept looking at that range.

- note that price is not on that list
- could mention the chromebook here (also "debian", not chromeos)

<!-- *** scope - reducing it make it possible for me -->

# Scope

- Washing-list of changes I want

- Skills to do only one or two things

- Look at my needs and focus on the important things

- What could I do about the Keyboard on newer laptops?

???
- So, now that I have a list of things I dont like, what can I do
- I'm not bunnie or purism - I cannot build a whole laptop
- so, reduce the scope to the minimum feature set
- all the modern laptops I looked at have keyboards I dont want
- Could I do something about that?

- but.. Backlight and Burnouts

<img width=1040 src="keyboard_short.jpg">

???
- I didnt notice this until much later
- all the keyboards I tried this with had had the same thing happen
- it turns out that there is a slightly different pinout, and they sent
  the high current backlight though the connector.
- Someone else pointed this out
- The Schematics I have are unclear

Not easy to see..

- I didnt believe them until I found this small mark
- Apparently, I was lucky - other people have had the burnout break
  the mouse buttons
- There is a insulating tape hack that can be applied to stop this
  from happening

TODO

- So, connectors and burnouts delt with, can I just use the keyboard? no..
- Seven-row vs Six-row keyboard

- On the x220 keyboard,..
- - Dead Keys: Insert, Home, Pause, PrtSc, ScrLk
- - Wrong Keys: Del, PgUp, PgDn, Win-R, Pg-back, Pg-fwd
- Fn-Combos that were not matching the icons
- - Multimedia keys, Brightness, Thinklight
- - Hibernate, Capslock, Screenlock, Battery

- seems a bit half-arsed, really

TODO - replace the x230 keyboard image with a better one

- hardware hacking is possible, if somewhat error prone and laborious

---

<!-- * first steps -->

# Its all just software...

- Schematics show all the dead keys are actually connected

<img width=1040 src="schematic_x230.jpg">

???
- Its a different Embedded controller on the two models, but the key matrix
  has keys in every row and column, so they all must be wired up.
- the Schematics agree

???
- If this was open source, I'd just update the code
- Found this assembly dump quite some time ago
- - It is for T4x and R5x laptops (T43 was from 2005)
- I can use the T43 dump as an Oracle to make predictions about what the
  key table might look like in the X220 and X230
- Match the keyboard master tables, and some other small bits
- Allows the beginnings of a firmware patch
- However, the x230 firmware doesnt look 'sane' (E.G: The Jump Tables are wierd)
- Still have no way to install my patch

- compliment Matthew on his talk, thank him for his software
- mention anything from his talk that seems relevant

- Assuming you missed his talk, he worked out how to decrypt his thinkpad
  Embedded Controller firmware, patch it, re-encrypt it and add the
  right checksums to let it be successfully flashed

- with mec tools, we can patch and successfully flash the new version

- If zmatt's talk didnt exist, I would have explained how the lenovo firmware
  encryption worked at this point

- FIXME - example of open source community, he did something, I can use it to
  do something different and bigger (standing on the shoulders of giants..)

<!-- ** radare2 -->

# More Reverse Engineering

- Simply patching keyLocTab doesnt fully work

- The Radare2 tool had support for the ARCompact instruction set

.center[
<img width=750 src="firmware_radare1.png">
<div class="caption">firmware excerpt - before fixing Radare2</div>
]

???
- With the ability to now patch the EC, I could try out simply updating
  the keysym table I found with the olf T43 firware.
- That had some success, remapping working keys.  The dead keys didnt come
  back to life though
- Searched around for something that supported the right CPU, found Radare2
- Its got a bit of a learning curve...
- This screenshot might not make sense to you, but I tell you that it doesnt
  make sense to me either
- Radare didnt actually support the ARC cpu very well.

---

<!-- ** improving the radare analysis -->

# Radare needed improvement

- Radare2 ARC support actually quite flakey

- E.G: scrolling backwards ended up going forwards!

- Worse, the ARCompact support appeared to be half missing

- Big endian only, no jump delay slot, jumps targets all wrong, no
  illegal instruction detection
.right[<img width=500 src="radare_patch1.png">]


???
- FIXME clarify or reduce the above
- In order to successfully dig into the firmware, I need to improve the tools
- some may call this yak shaving
- This is part of what I am trying to encourage - there was a problem with
  the tool, I fixed the tool
- maybe mention NUXI format used by the little endian instruction coding
- Even with all that mentioned, there are still a lot of things missing
  from this architecture in radare
- I did not implement all the radare features in this plugin - not by a
  long shot (some conditional branching, all "ESIL" stuff, stack frames
  and more - I'm sure)
- (also following the theme of picking up open source and improving it.)
---

# Improvements helped

- Plenty of features still to add

- Improved enough that analysis was usable


.center[

<div class="caption">same excerpt - after Radare2 fixes</div>

???
FIXME - add more?
- with better analysis, can go back to looking for more structures
- Remember, this is trying to get better analysis to fix the keyboard
- Note that much of the reverse engineering was code analysis as I looked
  for things like the capslock GPIO or the interface to the main CPU

---

# Radare is powerful

- Improving it helped me learn it

- Used it to return to looking for structures

<!-- ** issues with distribution -->

# Issues with distribution

- What is the copyright on the firmware?

- Just how much can I copy out without issues?

- How to make it easy, without infringing?

- What tools are even available?

  - on Windows?

???
- not my binaries, not allowed to distribute
FIXME - add more notes

<!-- ** supporting more hardware -->

# Supporting more hardware

- Originally, just expected x230

- Forum requests kept on appearing (Everyone has their own pet model)

- In the end, support 7 different models (all of the xx30 series)

- Repo structure was assuming just one

FIXME - could add screenshot from forum "hey can you add support for blah"
???
FIXME - add notes
- Could support more, but the low-hanging-fruit was everything from the same
  series as the x230 laptop - the "xx30" series.  I think I ended up supporting
  every single one from that series... (not intentionally missing one)

# Chapter 6: Digging into DOSFLASH

???
FIXME - chaptername?

<!-- ** Lenovo tools -->
<!-- * How does flashing work -->

# Lenovo tools

- Lenovo has a Windows tool, I didn't look at it

- Bootable CD contains "dosflash.exe"

- Boot to PC-DOS, no drivers, clean config

- Runs dosflash

  - loads firmware, *magic happens*

FIXME - add a screenshot of the lenovo tool?

???
FIXME - add notes

---

<!-- ** reversing dosflash -->

# Reversing dosflash

- Need to have a DOS strace tool

- Look at binary, djgpp CWSDPMI

- Have source for djgpp

- can unpack the flat 32bit bin

- Still no tracing, though

???
FIXME - add notes
- mention my old dos tracer
- TODO link to lwn
- djgpp?

<!-- *** writing a simple kvm hypervisor -->

# My kvm hypervisor

- "Using the KVM API" - https://lwn.net/Articles/658511/

- CWSDPMI interrupt calls

- DOS interrupt calls

- BIOS interrupt calls

- Ralf Brown Interrupt List - still the best resource

???
FIXME - add notes

- the Interrupt List has been a resource for a /long/ time

TODO - add a screenshot?
FIXME - make it clear that creating a KVM hypervisor is straight forward

<!-- *** itterating on implementing missing features -->

# iterating on implementing missing features
FIXME

- Trace DOSFLASH.EXE

- Add missing featues (ACPI..)

- Find the SMI

- Document Protocol

FIXME - add screenshot of heaps of trace output

???
- Once the basic stuff is up and running, can use the tracing and debug
  output to show me what the dosflash.exe is doing
- Wrote a minimal 'fake' ACPI bios that passes all the tests that
  DOSFLASH.EXE does
- Once that was right, could find the SMI calls
- Briefly explain SMI
- Try to document the protocol
- Mention that this is so far a dead end.

<!-- ** writing a device driver for real hardware -->

# device driver for real hardware
FIXME - title

- Progress stalled

- need a kernel driver and real hardware (dangerous)

FIXME - add screenshot from protocol trace SMI

???
- the emulation is at the point where it needs some answer from the hardware
  that I am just not giving it
- So, to get past this, I need to replay some of the protocol on real hardware
- Have seen the abort sequence, so just need to be careful
- Needs a kernel driver, because 32bit access (64bit in some places) and direct
  physical mappings needed.  (Also, I didnt really want to go back to
  writinf DOS programs)

FIXME - add notes

<!-- ** how is the firmware protected? is this a risk -->

# how is the firmware protected?

- x220, x230 - parts encrypted

- x250 - better layout, looks similar encryption

- x260 - no encryption, probably a signature

???
- x220 EC uses a different CPU and different encryption keys
- x250 has done away with a lot of padding in their flash file
- x260 has what appears to be a 256bute signature in the file - thus
  affording better protection than any of the other ones.
FIXME - x270

# Chapter 7: Winding up

???
FIXME - chapter name?
---

<!-- * next steps -->

# Next Steps

- Continue tracing SMI

- Build a USB keyboard adaptor

- Try to get newer hardware

- Look for alternative laptops (open?)

???
- I would like to continue discovering how the DOSFLASH tool works.  This
  would need the change of tools
- A partially finished USB keyboard circuit exists, which would allow me to
  try and retrofit any other hardware with this laptop
- With newer hardware, I could take measurements for cutting the case apart
  and attempt other invasive actions to force a new keyboard into it
- Still want a newer laptop..
- Keeping my eyes open for alternatives that fix other issues, might allow me
  to feel less forced into the laptop replacement
- Can mention chrombook+debian and/or cheap intel-based tablets.

<!-- ** Still want a newer laptop, dont want to spend money without keyboard -->
<!-- ** build a usb adaptor for the raw keyboard -->

# FIXME - what do you want to do

???
TODO:
- encourage people to discuss what they want to change on their laptop
- ask audrey for more ideas if needed on this slide :-)
